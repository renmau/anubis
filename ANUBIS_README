ANUBIS is an extension of RAMSES including massive neutrino particles.

cosmo_neutrinos.nml shows an example for a run file with massive neutrinos and an extarnal hubble
function file. 

The input files are in gadget format and separate for the cdm and neutrinos. 

Changes have been made in the files:
- pm/move_fine.f90
- pm/synchro_fine.f90
- pm/init_part.f90
- pm/rho_fine.f90
- amr/amr_parameters.f90
- amr/read_params.f90
- hydro/read_hydro_params.f90

No changes have currently been implemented in the time-stepping method. 

The code was compiled with
- Intel_parallel_studio/2019/3.062
- gcc/8.3.1
- python/2.7

For multiple nodes and cpus and a log-file it can be run like:
mpirun -np 144 -perhost 16 -hostfile hostfile.txt ./ramses3d cosmo.nml | tee -a log.txt
